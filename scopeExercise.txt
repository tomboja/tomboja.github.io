1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
  x = 1;
  var a = 5;
  var b = 10;
  var c = function(a, b, c) {
      var x = 10;
      document.write(x);
      document.write(a);
      var f = function(a, b, c) {
          b = a;
          document.write(b);
          b = c;
          var x = 5;
      }
      f(a,b,c);
      document.write(b);
 }
c(8,9,10); // 10, 8
document.write(b);
document.write(x);

OUTPUT: 10  8  8  9  10  1


2. What is the difference between a method and function?

ANS: Method is a function that belongs to an object/class

3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

ANS: this in Java refers to the current object of the class

4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?

ANS: It has different values depending on where it is used:
      In a method, this refers to the owner object.
      Alone, this refers to the global object.
      In a function, this refers to the global object.
      In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
      In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
      Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?

ANS: this in Javascript constructor refers to the current object being instantiated with the class constructor

6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

ANS: this in this case refers to the prototype object which is x

7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?

ANS: Free variables are variables that exist in outer scope of an inner function and
 can be used in an inner function, without being passed or declared in the inner function.
 The inner function will have access to the free variables which ineffect results in closure

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and 
  a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, 
  or the square of the two if they are equal.

{
  name: 'fred',
  major: 'music',
  smallestOrSquare: function(a, b) {
    if (a === b) {
      return a * b
    } else {
      return Math.min(a, b)
    }
  }
}

9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword 
and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position


class Employee {
  constructor(name, salary, position) {
    this.name = name
    this.salary = salary
    this.position = position
  }
}

let emp1 = new Employee('Tom', '200000', 'Manager')
let emp2 = new Employee('James', '170000', 'Software Engineer')
let emp3 = new Employee('Sara', '150000', 'Software Designer')

10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments

let product = function(a, b, ...more) {
  let prod = 1
  prod *= a * b
  for(const element of more) {
    prod *= element
  }

  return prod
}

11.  Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.

const max = (a, b, c) => Math.max(a, b, c)
